# Neumorphism Clock

A simple analog clock made using web technologies.  
This project was made for learning the concepts of:

1. Neumorphism
2. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)

So this little web app is installable on your devices.

- Tap in the **Options menu** in Chrome (the _triple dots_)
- Select the option **Add to Home screen**
- Click on **Add** when the pop-up appears

Now the app is added to your homescreen. You can now directly access it
by clicking on the icon instead of searching it on the web!
